# vector_visualise
A c++ header file for visualizing points, vectors, and planes.   

## TODO:
* create a graphics module to dispaly vectors.  
* Set up SDL for the project.  
* display functions, to create screen, and draw objects.  
* add basic transformations for points (maybe).   
* optimize as far as my sanity will allow (do this last).
