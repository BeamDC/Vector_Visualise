# vector_visualise
A c++ header file for visualizing points, vectors, and planes.   

## TODO: 
display functions, to create screen, and draw objects.
1. Set up SDL for the project
    * display functions, to create screen, and draw objects.
2. add basic transformations for points (maybe).   
3. optimize as far as my sanity will allow (do this last).
